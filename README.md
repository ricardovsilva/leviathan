# Leviathan
Leviathan is a system to save homeless and abandoned animals.

## History Behind Leviathan
[Ricardo](github.com/ricardovsilva) and his wife were traveling to Ricardo's hometown, Cabo-Frio (Brazil) - 600Km away from where they live -, and they found a little (really little) black cat puppy. The little cat was starving and with mange. They treat Leviatã desease and travel with he to their home, in return, Leviatã gave to Ricardo and Marcela unconditional love for two and a half year. Until he finally, and unfortunately, died hit by a car.
Even little living, Leviatã was happy and had a life full of love.

As Leviatã, a lot of other animals are living abandoned in streets. Some of they born in street, others are abandoned because people thinks that animals are just toys that you can throw away.
In memory to Leviatã, I'm trying to help animals around the world, developing a system that anyone can implement, trying to connect people who really wants to help with animals that must be helped.
